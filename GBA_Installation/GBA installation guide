GBA Tools Installation instructions for Ubuntu or Debian

Steps 1,2,3 are required for HW8, for HW9+ step 4 is required.
Step 1 The GBA Compiler

Download the file cs2110-tools_1.0-1_i386.deb or cs2110-tools_1.0-1_amd64.deb (if you have a 32-bit or 64-bit installation, respectively).
Open up a terminal and then navigate to the folder where you saved the downloaded file.
In the terminal, type in sudo dpkg -i cs2110-tools_1.0-1_i386.deb (or _amd64.deb). You may have to type in your password.
If the installation succeeds, you should see output like this:
Selecting previously deselected package cs2110-tools.
(Reading database ... 123389 files and directories currently installed.)
Unpacking cs2110-tools (from cs2110-tools_1.0-1_i386.deb) ...
Setting up cs2110-tools (1.0-1) ...
Step 2 The GBA Emulators (vbam and wxvbam)

Downlaod the file cs2110-tools-emulator-x.y.z-<arch>.deb (where arch is i386 for 32 bit and amd64 for 64 bit)
Follow steps 2-4 above (use steps 3-7 here to troubleshoot if it installs perfectly go to step 8)
Note that you may not have all of the dependencies installed to have the package install correctly you may have something along the lines of the following
dependency problems prevent configuration of cs2110-tools-emulator:
 cs2110-tools-emulator depends on libwxgtk2.8-0 (>= 2.8.11); however:
  Package libwxgtk2.8-0 is not installed.
Simply install the appropriate package and try again.  (ex. sudo apt-get install libwxgtk2.8-0)
You may also issue the following command instead (sudo apt-get install -f)
If 5-6 doesn't work then you do not have the latest packages.  You can issue the following command to update your packages (sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade).  This may take awhile.
For anything else DO AS THE TERMINAL SAYS
To test if it works type vbam or wxvbam in a terminal. 
Step 3 GBA Debugging support (printf) 

Make sure you have done steps 1 and 2 first.
Download the file cs2110-tools-debug.tar.gz
Extract the archive
In a terminal where you have extracted the archive (you should have a .h file and a .a file)  type "sudo make" (without the quotes)  You may be asked for your password.
Step 4 brandontools [necessary to get images into GBA games]

Download brandontools.tar.gz
Extract the archive
sudo apt-get install libmagick++-dev libmagickwand-dev libmagickcore-dev
sudo apt-get install build-essential
make
sudo make install
Troubleshooting

The Debian/Ubuntu packages were developed on Linux Mint 13 (for 32-bit) and should only work on Mint 13/Ubuntu 12.04 or higher.
If you get an error along the lines of "cannot find package libsdl1.2debian", you need to run sudo apt-get update first.
These tools will not work on Windows or Mac computers.
